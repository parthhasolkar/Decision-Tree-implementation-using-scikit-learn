# Decision-Tree-implementation-using-scikit-learn
This project implements a basic Decision Tree Classifier using a CSV dataset for classification tasks.

📁 Dataset
classification_dataset.csv

🛠️ Libraries
pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

🔧 Workflow
Load and preprocess the data

Split into train and test sets

One-hot encode categorical columns

Train a Decision Tree (max_depth=4, criterion='gini')

Predict and evaluate using accuracy and classification report

Visualize:

Confusion Matrix

Decision Tree structure

📊 Output
Accuracy score

Classification report
